# Introduction

This project aims to use SQL for analysis of a store's database to generate insights. During analysis, several questions/problems have been sovled using SQL, where a number of relational tables such as customer, employeedata, invoice distribution, music genres etc. are included.Please see the schematic of the relational database for a more detailed explanation of DB. In the analysis, CTEs, windows functions and aggregated functions were used, see script for more detailed syntax.

# Prerequisites

SQL database(MySQL)

SQL client (MySQL workbench)

# Usage 
Open your SQL client

Connect to your SQL database 

Copy and paste provided SQL queries 

Execute to perform analysis
